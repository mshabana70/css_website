NOTES (Sec 5, Lec 44, "CSS BOX MODEL")

- Imagine every element as a box
- Whenever resizing an element, elements around it are displaced according to the resizing
- When adding a border, you are adding to the size of the element.
- {border-top: 0px;} This makes the top border of the element zero pixels
- {border-width: 0px 10px 20px 30px;} 0px at top, 10px at right, 20px at bottom, 30px at left. Clockwise around a box! (top, right, bottom, left)
- Padding is a CSS shorthand property that sets the padding area on all four sides of an elements content at once.
- [Padding Visual](images/padding_screenshot.png)
- [Margin Visual](images/margin_screenshot.png)
- Border and padding change the size of the div or other elements
- Margin has no effect on the size of the element
